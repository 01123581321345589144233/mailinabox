# Mail-in-a-Box Dockerfile

###########################

# To build the image:
# sudo docker.io build -t box .

# To run a container for testing (with a command prompt and no publicly exposed ports):
# sudo docker.io run -i -t -P box

# Or to run in the background and expose all of the ports so that the *host* acts as a Mail-in-a-Box:
# (the SSH port is only available locally, but other ports are exposed publicly and must be available
# otherwise the container won't start)
# sudo docker.io run -d -p 22 -p 25:25 -p 53:53/udp -p 443:443 -p 587:587 -p 993:993 box
